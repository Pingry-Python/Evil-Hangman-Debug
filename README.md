### Overview
This is not a complete project and cannot be run on its own. It is just a function that can be used to help implement debugging mode in the evil hangman assignment.

### Arguments and Return
The function takes one argument which is a dictionary and returns None

The dictionary keys should be strings representing word families, and the values are lists of words in those families.

### Example Data
If the game uses four letter words and the user has guessed the letter 'a', the argument would be:

<pre>
{'----': ["four", "tile", "mike", "bird", "nuts"] ,
 '-a--': ["cars", "bats", "bars", "hard"] ,
 '--a-': ["brat", "snap", "flat"] ,
 'a-a-': ["alan"] }
</pre>
